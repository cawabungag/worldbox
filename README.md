# Voxel World in Unity with ECS Architecture

## Project Overview

This Unity project implements a voxel-based world built with the **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture. The project combines procedural generation, world editing, vegetation creation, and weather mapping to deliver a dynamic and interactive environment.

### Key Features

1. **Voxel World Generation**  
   - Procedural terrain generation using **Perlin Noise** for creating realistic landscapes like mountains, plains, and bodies of water.
   - Optimized chunk-based rendering to improve performance in large worlds.
   
2. **World Editing**  
   - Real-time editing capabilities, allowing users to add, remove, or modify voxels dynamically.
   - Supports seamless updates to affected chunks without performance drops.

3. **Vegetation Generation**  
   - Procedural generation of trees, grass, and other vegetation based on biome-specific rules.
   - Dynamic placement adapted to terrain elevation and type.

4. **Weather Map Integration**  
   - A weather system that influences vegetation growth, terrain features, and overall visuals.
   - Weather maps determine regions with varying humidity, temperature, and precipitation.

5. **World Persistence**  
   - Save and load systems to ensure user changes are stored.
   - Compression techniques for efficient file storage and fast loading times.
